# C-SQD domain model

Confirmed product rules, corrected September 15, 2026. Start here when changing
the code or documentation. These rules record the user's confirmed clarifications.
The [deployment profile](cs_mail_deployment_profile.tex) gives the detailed
financial-program requirements; the [protocol specification](cs_mail_protocol_spec.tex)
governs requests and communication permission. The
[Rust architecture](cs_mail_rust_reference_architecture.tex) describes their
implementation. Implementation choices must not silently become product rules.

## Person, account, and authority

- For the current product, one identifiable person has one account and may have
  multiple email addresses. Identity is tied to a verified bank account.
- Account, member, private principal, and public communication identity are
  distinct roles and scoped identifiers for that person, not permission to create
  multiple accounts or member shares. Keep bank and identity evidence out of
  messages, relationship records, and telemetry.
- Organizational legacy senders and possible future protocol participants do not
  establish organizational C-SQD accounts as part of this product.
- Account actions require explicit account authority. Permission to send messages
  is not permission to change financial policy. Separate signing contexts do not
  require a second user-managed billing credential.
- Assume one configured payment-processing arrangement. A communication-service
  provider and a payment processor are different roles; federation terminology
  does not imply multiple payment processors.

## Annual service purchase

The full annual utility charge purchases a specified year-long service period.
Collection occurs well before that period starts. A failed collection and its
retry have the same agreed price and service period; payment timing does not
shift or extend coverage. New coverage requires verified finalized funding and
the current time to fall within that period. Late funding is not retroactive.

Keep four concepts separate: **collection date, service period, completed pool
year, and distribution date**. Do not derive them from a single billing-cycle
date. Exact calendar/anniversary anchors, collection lead time, and distribution
dates remain explicit policy decisions, not universal defaults. Multiple future
charges are not an assumed normal workflow.

## One annual distribution

One ordinary distribution payment covers the person's share `D_i` of the
**previous calendar year's company-wide collateral pool**. Qualifying members
receive equal shares under the published eligibility policy. The existing
once-only corporate assessment, restricted carryforward, and maturity rules
remain defined by the deployment profile.

For annual utility charge `U` (the clarified example is `$120`):

```
rebate/refund reporting component: R_i = min(D_i, U)
excess cash reporting component:   X_i = max(0, D_i - U)
single distribution payment:       R_i + X_i = D_i
```

| Allocation | Rebate classification | Excess classification | Bank payment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $80 | $80 | $0 | One payment of $80 |
| $120 | $120 | $0 | One payment of $120 |
| $170 | $120 | $50 | One payment of $170 |

The classifications are bookkeeping and reporting only. They are not separately
executed refund and payout legs and do not have separate completion states.
Processor-refundable capacity does not determine the rebate. A zero allocation
creates no external payment.

C-SQD automatically forwards the lump sum to the verified bank account associated
with the person's account. There is no independently chosen distribution
destination, per-distribution instruction, or member-selected payout minimum.
No cross-year aggregation or payment-threshold rule has been adopted.

Distribution is independent of renewal. Ordinarily it occurs during a service
year whose annual utility charge was already paid. A pending or failed charge
for the next year cannot delay, reclassify, or cancel the distribution. The
earlier service charge and the distribution are separate transactions; a
distribution does not revoke purchased coverage.

The distribution has one obligation and one payment lifecycle. Unknown processor
outcomes are reconciled under the same operation identity. A definite failure
can permit a new attempt for the same obligation; it does not create another
allocation. Failed, delayed, or reversed payments remain owed and are not
redistributed in the next year's pool. Authorized corrections must state their
cause and funding; they do not rewrite the annual allocation.

Closure preserves a minimal route for outstanding distributions and refunds.
It does not require renewal to receive money already owed. Full account
management, bank-account replacement, and detailed erasure policy remain deferred.

## Request refunds remain actual refunds

A relationship request has one conditional charge `C + S`. Acceptance refunds
the full charge; expiry refunds `S`; rejection retains `C` and moves `S` into
pending forfeiture for the pool. Cancellation before submission returns the full
charge. These are real capture-linked refund obligations, unlike the reporting
classification within an annual distribution. Follow-ups add no charge.

## Enforcement boundaries

Rust types and validated transitions distinguish immutable service terms,
verified evidence, member preferences, operator policy, and payment states.
Durable transactions must still check current funding restrictions at dispatch,
enforce person/account uniqueness, and prevent concurrent duplicate payments.
A previously constructed Rust value cannot establish that external state has
remained unchanged.
